This code takes the dataset of school shootings and identifies some key statistics and facts. It doesn't do much aside from identify the number of shootings and then obtain a list of the deadliest shootings

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
df <- read.csv("SSDB_dataset.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df <- df %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(reliability_score_1_to_5=  reliability_score_1_5) %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date))
df %>% count(category)
df

df_indiscriminate %>% arrange(date)
df_indiscriminate %>% arrange(-killed_includes_shooter)
```
